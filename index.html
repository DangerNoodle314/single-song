    <p>Bitch, I'm dead fresh, I might pull up in a casket;

    <p>Ride in the back of the truck with the pump
      With a mask covering my face
      Double the Glock 'cause I rip through the flesh
      Inside of the Cutty with thing on my waist
      Kick in the door, point me to the safe
      Fuckin' the posters up with all the bass
      Heat-seeking missiles, I load up and hit you
      I carry the coffin and drop it in grave</p>
    <p>(HO)</p>
